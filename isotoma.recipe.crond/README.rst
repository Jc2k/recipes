cron.d buildout recipe
======================

This package provides buildout_ recipes for the configuration of cron jobs.
It creates files that are suitable for use in /etc/cron.d.

We use the system cron, so this recipe will not install cron for you.  If
you wish to install cron, use `zc.recipe.cmmi`_ perhaps.
